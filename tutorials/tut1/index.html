        </header>

        <p>Live evaluation of cybersecurity defenses, or red team engagements, can be costly, difficult to commission,
          and inconsistent in scope, detail, and results. This high overhead prevents many organizations from fully
          using them despite their benefits. The objective of CALDERA is to enable automated assessment of a network’s
          susceptibility to an adversary, essentially allowing an organization to see their network through the eyes of
          attackers on demand. CALDERA features an adversary model that maps to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework and an
          extensible planning system able to select and execute techniques. Inspired by automated planning
          methodologies, CALDERA provides a flexible, mature platform for developing adaptive and intelligent cyber
          agents.</p>

        <p>Our tutorial will encourage automated planning researchers to apply their skills to pressing cybersecurity
          issues. Towards this end, we will introduce attendees to CALDERA, and use CALDERA to automate attacks against
          an enterprise network. Attendees will learn how CALDERA gathers information and makes decisions, as well as
          how to modify those capabilities and run their own cybersecurity trials.</p>
